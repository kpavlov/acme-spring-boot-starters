# Acme springboot starters

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/kpavlov/acme-spring-boot-starters/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kpavlov/acme-spring-boot-starters/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

The project is a Spring Boot starter example. It discussed in detail in [my blog post](https://kpavlov.me/blog/spring-boot-starters/)

Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They simplify the dependency management for your project, as you only need to include the starter you need, and it will automatically manage the related dependencies for you.

The project is written in Kotlin and provides an example of using Spring Boot Starter to for logging configuration as well as for Beans custom configuration.

## How to use

Run the project with the following command:

```shell
mvn clean verify
```
